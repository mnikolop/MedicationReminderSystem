Thesis_project
=======================


This is a stable version of my thesis project.

The project is a web based platform for therapy reminder.

There are 2 users the doctor and the patient.

Each one has to make an account.
The doctor can see and manage the prescriptions that he has administered to his patients.
The patient can see which therapy and when he has to take (BUG = the therapies are not presented correctly).
